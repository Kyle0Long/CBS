Cokt awoke in a pile of hay, groggy and sad. As his senses came to, and after internalizing what had just happened, he laid back into the hay and began to sob. He was soon interrupted by two men walking by, describing tales they had heard about a cult in the next town over. Without wasting a second, Cokt wiped his nose, grabbed his new weapon, and head towards the town, determined to take on the cult and avenge his brothers.
