Rexton Redbrand is a Human hunter, known far and wide for hunting Giants. He travelled around to exotic locations, tracking down and killing the various types of Giants that lived in the area. Despite his popularity with the Human world, he was not widely discussed among the Giants, as their society is much more removed from the hustle, bustle, and celebrities in puny human society.

Rexton commissioned [[Kovir]] the Giant to create the Nine Realm's first [[Firearm]].

The Redbrand family are devout worshippers of Tiamat, though Rexton cares much more about hunting, fame, money, looking cool, and Elven women than "some dragon". He's more of a black sheep to them, and not very high or respected in their ranks.
