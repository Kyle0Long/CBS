Krilrym Quartzheart is a Giant Bard. He grew up with the Dwarves, who raised him and integrated him into their society. He was taken in by a clan of miners, one of which was a Bard himself. Krilrym worked with the miners in the mines, most closely to the Bard, helping inspire them. Though he could not fit into the same spaces, due to his stature, he was eager to help carry their spoils or inspire them through his music. When a new buyer searching for precious gems, Kovir, came to accept a shipment, Krilrym was quickly sold off to the Estate for a small fee. He became yet another inspirer on the Estate, singing his Dwarven tunes to help his brothers get through their days.

After the events of the Revolt, Krilrym has not been seen by anyone. His whereabouts are a complete mystery.
