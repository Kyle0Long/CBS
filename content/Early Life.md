Cokt's earliest memory is behind bars, with the sound of horseshoes and thumping in the background. Falling in and out of sleep and feeling very out of his own control, he remembers being held by enormous hands, strange noises being spoken, and being awoken by a soon familiar face. [[Kovir]] the Giant, was standing in front of the Goblin, looking perplexed and confused. The first thing that was ever said to Cokt, in his memory, were the words "Time for work, little one.", spoken in Giant. Kovir immediately put Cokt to work, sending him to get anything the craftsman needed during the day. Kovir was not a cruel master to Cokt, but, other than rage, he did not show any emotion to Cokt. Their relationship was sterile at best.

Cokt was able to find a family in the other slaves. The Giants took him in as one of their own. Cokt stayed in a cot in the mansion, while the others slept in their quarters outside, but Cokt would sneak away any chance he got to see his pseudo-family. They taught him Giant, let him join them in their games and rest, and explained the intricacies of Kovir and his business dealings as best they could. They taught him their songs and how to do the work they were performing. Cokt would steal any bits of food he could from the kitchen and any medical supplies to give to the Giants. After some time, the Giants addressed Cokt as their "brother", and he thought of them as his.
